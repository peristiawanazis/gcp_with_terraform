### Why do I need this?
we are lazy ass, we don't want to click-that and click-this for just to create stack in GCP. We just want to type and press button over the same window.

### Ok, Ya, just show me the way it works?

  1.1 setup in your local machine, after clone this repo, run the init.sh script:
